; Description: HTML with jQuery.  Program intentionally has two errors
;
; The program will show an H1 and H2 and 4 p tags with a button
; The button, when clicked, should hide the paragraphs.
;
; One error is a syntax error - something is not typed correctly
; One error is more of a logic error - remember, things within the <p> tag
; should be hidden when the button is clicked.  If anything else is hidden,
; that is incorrect and needs to be fixed.
